# Read ABARES' "Historical Forecast Database"

Fetches and imports ABARES "Historical Forecast Database" performance
data.

## Usage

``` r
read_historical_forecast_database(x = NULL)

read_historical_forecast(x = NULL)
```

## Source

<https://daff.ent.sirsidynix.net.au/client/en_AU/search/asset/1031941/0>.

## Arguments

- x:

  A file path providing the file with the data to be imported. The file
  is assumed to be unarchived locally. This function does not provide
  any checking whether this function is the proper function for the
  provided file. Defaults to `NULL`, assuming that the file will be
  downloaded in the active R session.

## Value

A
[`data.table::data.table()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/data.table/man/data.table.html)
object.

## Note

Columns are renamed for consistency with other ABARES products serviced
in this package using a snake_case format and ordered consistently.

The "Month_issued" column is converted from a character string to a
numeric value representing the month of year, *e.g.*, "March" is
converted to `3`.
