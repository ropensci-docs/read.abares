# Read ABARES' "Australian Gridded Farm Data" (AGFD) NCDF Files with terra

Read "Australian Gridded Farm Data", (AGFD), as a
[`terra::rast()`](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/rast.html)
object.

## Usage

``` r
read_agfd_terra(yyyy = 1991:2023, fixed_prices = TRUE, x = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- yyyy:

  Returns only data for the specified year or years for climate data
  (fixed prices) or the years for historical climate and prices
  depending upon the setting of `fixed_prices`. Note that this will
  still download the entire data set, that cannot be avoided, but will
  only return the requested year(s) in your R session. Valid years are
  from 1991 to 2023 inclusive.

- fixed_prices:

  Download historical climate and prices or historical climate and fixed
  prices as described in (Hughes *et al.* 2022). Defaults to `TRUE` and
  downloads the data with historical climate and fixed prices "to
  isolate the effects of climate variability on financial incomes for
  broadacre farm businesses" (ABARES 2024). Using `TRUE` will download
  simulations where global output and input price indexes are fixed at
  values from the most recently completed financial year.

- x:

  A file path providing the file with the data to be imported. The file
  is assumed to be unarchived (*i.e.*, still zipped). This function does
  not provide any checking whether this function is the proper function
  for the provided file. Defaults to `NULL`, assuming that the file will
  be downloaded in the active R session.

## Value

objects of the "Australian Gridded Farm Data" with the NetCDF objects'
names as "year_yyyy".

## Details

From the [ABARES
website](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data/australian-gridded-farm-data):
"The Australian Gridded Farm Data (AGFD) are a set of national scale
maps containing simulated data on historical broadacre farm business
outcomes including farm profitability on an 0.05-degree (approximately 5
km) grid.  
These data have been produced by ABARES as part of the ongoing
Australian Agricultural Drought Indicator (AADI) project (previously
known as the Drought Early Warning System Project) and were derived
using ABARES
[*farmpredict*](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/climate/drought/farmpredict)
model, which in turn is based on ABARES Agricultural and Grazing
Industries Survey (AAGIS) data.

model, which in turn is based on ABARES [Agricultural and Grazing
Industries
Survey](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-definitions-methods)
(AAGIS) data.  
These maps provide estimates of farm business profit, revenue, costs and
production by location (grid cell) and year for the period 1990-91 to
2022-23. The data do not include actual observed outcomes but rather
model predicted outcomes for representative or 'typical' broadacre farm
businesses at each location considering likely farm characteristics and
prevailing weather conditions and commodity prices."

If you have not already downloaded the files, both sets of data are
large in file size, *i.e.*, \>1GB, and will require time to download.

## Model scenarios

### Historical Climate (fixed prices)

The Historical Climate (fixed prices) scenario is similar to that
described in Hughes *et al.* (2022) and is intended to isolate the
effects of climate variability on financial incomes for broadacre farm
businesses. In these simulations, global output and input price indexes
are fixed at values from the most recently completed financial year.
However, in these scenarios the spread between domestic and global grain
(wheat, barley and sorghum) prices, along with Australian fodder prices
are allowed to vary in response to climate data (to capture domestic
increases in grain and fodder prices in drought years, see Hughes *et
al.* 2022). A 33-year historical climate sequence (including historical
simulated crop and pasture data from the AADI project) is simulated for
each grid cell (1990-91 to 2022-23).

### Historical Climate and Prices

As part of the AADI project an additional scenario was developed
accounting for changes in both climate conditions and output and input
prices (*i.e.*, global commodity market variability). In this historical
climate and prices scenario the 33-year reference period allows for
variation in both historical climate conditions and historical prices.
For this scenario, historical price indexes were de-trended, to account
for consistent long-term trends in some real commodity prices
(particularly sheep and lamb). The resulting simulation results and
percentile indicators are intended to reflect the combined impacts of
annual climate and commodity price variability."

## Data files

Simulation output data are saved as multilayer NetCDF files, which are
named using following convention:

`f<farm year>.c<climate year>.p<price year>.t<technology year>.nc`

where:

- `<farm year>` = Financial year of farm business data is used in
  simulations.

- `<climate year>` = Financial year of climate data is used in
  simulations.

- `<price year>` = Financial year of output and input prices used in
  simulations.

- `<technology year>` = Financial year of farm 'technology' (equal to
  farm year in all simulations) Here financial years are referred to by
  the closing calendar year (*e.g.*, 2022 = 1 July 2021 to 30 June
  2022).
